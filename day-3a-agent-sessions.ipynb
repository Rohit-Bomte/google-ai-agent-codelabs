    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "**1. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Uncovering Novel Targets:** AI algorithms are becoming incredibly adept at analyzing vast biological datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, patient data) to identify previously unknown disease-causing genes or proteins (targets). This goes beyond traditional hypothesis-driven research.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI can now predict whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning a molecule can be designed to interact with it effectively. This saves significant time and resources by filtering out unpromising targets early on.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** Companies like **Recursion Pharmaceuticals** and **Insitro** are heavily invested in using AI to map cellular biology and identify new targets for a range of diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Generative AI for Molecule Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **De Novo Design:** This is a game-changer. Generative AI models (like those based on transformers and GANs) can \"dream up\" entirely new molecular structures that are optimized for specific properties (e.g., binding affinity to a target, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles).\n",
      "*   **\"Designer Molecules\":** Instead of screening existing libraries, researchers can now generate bespoke molecules tailored to hit a particular target with high specificity and efficacy.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** **Atomwise** uses deep learning for structure-based drug design, and companies like **Cresset** offer platforms for molecular modeling and design.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Accelerated Preclinical Testing and Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can predict how candidate molecules will behave in the body, including their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, as well as their potential toxicity. This drastically reduces the need for costly and time-consuming wet lab experiments in the early stages.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Efficacy:** AI models are being trained to predict the likelihood of a drug candidate showing efficacy in preclinical models and even early human trials.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** **BenevolentAI** uses its platform to analyze biomedical literature and data to identify drug targets and predict potential treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Advancements in Specific Disease Areas:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Oncology:** AI is proving highly effective in identifying new cancer targets, predicting patient response to immunotherapy, and designing novel cancer drugs, particularly for difficult-to-treat cancers.\n",
      "*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's):** AI is helping to unravel the complex mechanisms behind these diseases and identify new therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "*   **Infectious Diseases:** AI is being used to accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics and antivirals, a critical area given rising antimicrobial resistance.\n",
      "*   **Rare Diseases:** AI's ability to analyze sparse data can be particularly valuable for developing treatments for rare genetic disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Integrating Multi-Omics Data:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Holistic View:** AI is crucial for integrating and interpreting data from various \"omics\" layers (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to get a more comprehensive understanding of disease biology and drug response.\n",
      "*   **Biomarker Discovery:** This integrated approach helps in identifying reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and predicting treatment effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Novel Modalities:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Beyond Small Molecules:** While AI is revolutionizing small molecule drug discovery, it's also being applied to new drug modalities like RNA-based therapies, protein degraders (PROTACs), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges and the Future:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these advances, challenges remain. Validating AI-generated hypotheses in the lab is still essential. Ensuring data quality and addressing algorithmic bias are critical. However, the trajectory is clear: AI is no longer a futuristic concept in drug discovery; it's a fundamental tool that is reshaping the entire process, promising faster, more efficient, and more personalized drug development.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get the absolute latest, I'd recommend following specific companies in the biotech AI space and keeping an eye on publications from institutions like **MIT, Stanford, and Broad Institute**, as well as major pharma companies that are investing heavily in AI.\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **\"Generative AI for Molecule Design\"** development. This is a truly groundbreaking area in drug discovery, so let's dive deeper!\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is Generative AI for Molecule Design?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, drug discovery involved:\n",
      "1.  **Identifying a disease target.**\n",
      "2.  **Screening vast libraries of existing chemical compounds** to find ones that might interact with that target. This is like searching for a specific key in a giant, pre-existing keychain.\n",
      "3.  **Optimizing promising candidates** through iterative chemical synthesis and testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI flips this model by allowing scientists to **\"design\" molecules from scratch** that are specifically tailored to a particular purpose. It's like being able to create a brand new key that's perfectly shaped to unlock a specific lock, rather than hoping to find one that fits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Does it Work?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI models, particularly those based on deep learning architectures like:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of known molecules. By sampling from this latent space and decoding, they can generate new molecular structures.\n",
      "*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** GANs involve two neural networks – a generator (which creates molecules) and a discriminator (which tries to distinguish between real and generated molecules). Through competition, the generator gets better and better at producing realistic and novel molecules.\n",
      "*   **Transformer Networks (similar to those used in language models):** These can learn the \"grammar\" of chemical structures and generate new valid molecular sequences or graphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "These models are trained on enormous datasets of known molecules, their properties, and their interactions. They learn the underlying rules and patterns that govern molecular structure and behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Capabilities and Advantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **De Novo (From Scratch) Design:** The most significant advantage is the ability to generate entirely novel molecular structures that may not exist in any current database. This opens up a vast chemical space for exploration.\n",
      "2.  **Optimized for Specific Properties:** Scientists can guide the generative process by specifying desired characteristics. This includes:\n",
      "    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly the molecule binds to the target protein.\n",
      "    *   **Selectivity:** Ensuring it binds only to the intended target and not others, minimizing off-target effects.\n",
      "    *   **Pharmacokinetic Properties (ADME):** How the molecule is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the body.\n",
      "    *   **Solubility and Stability:** Practical considerations for formulation and delivery.\n",
      "    *   **Toxicity:** Predicting and avoiding potential harmful side effects.\n",
      "3.  **Faster Iteration Cycles:** Instead of manually designing and synthesizing variations, AI can propose numerous optimized candidates rapidly, significantly shortening the design-build-test-learn cycle.\n",
      "4.  **Exploring Novel Chemical Space:** Generative AI can venture into uncharted chemical territory, potentially discovering entirely new classes of drugs that traditional methods might miss.\n",
      "5.  **Reduced Reliance on High-Throughput Screening (HTS):** While HTS is still valuable, generative AI can pre-filter and design molecules with a higher probability of success, reducing the cost and time associated with large-scale screening.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Companies and Platforms:**\n",
      "\n",

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",
